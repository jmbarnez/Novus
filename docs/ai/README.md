# AI System Documentation

## Overview

The AI system has been completely refactored into a **clean, modular, behavior-based architecture** with **zero legacy patterns**.

## Quick Navigation

### For Getting Started
- **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** - Add a behavior in 5 minutes
- **[Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Understand how the system works
- **[Behavior Patterns](PATTERNS.md)** - Common behavior examples

### For Understanding Details
- **[Complete Refactoring](REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md)** - What changed and why
- **[Clean Design](CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Benefits of unified architecture

## What Is the AI System?

The AI system controls all enemy entities in the game:
- **Combat AI** - Patrol, chase, and orbit the player
- **Mining AI** - Mine asteroids autonomously
- **Behavior-based** - Easy to add new behaviors
- **Registry pattern** - Clean, extensible design

## Key Components

### Single AI Component
```lua
{
    type = "combat" | "mining",
    state = "patrol" | "chase" | "orbit",
    detectionRadius = 1200,
    patrolPoints = {...},
}
```

### Three Built-in Behaviors
1. **Patrol** - Wander or follow waypoints
2. **Chase** - Pursue player to get in range
3. **Orbit** - Maintain distance while attacking

### Unified AISystem
- Detects player
- Updates AI state
- Dispatches to appropriate behavior
- Handles both combat and mining AI

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Behavior
See **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

### Understanding How AI Works
See **[Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for detailed explanation.

### Seeing Examples
See **[Behavior Patterns](PATTERNS.md)** for code examples.

### Learning About Changes
See **[Complete Refactoring](REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md)** for what was refactored.
