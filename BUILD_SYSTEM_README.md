## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "love is not recognized" | Install LÖVE 11.3 with PATH option |
| "7z is not recognized" | Install 7-Zip with PATH option OR use BUILD_SIMPLE.bat |
| .love file won't open | Associate .love with LÖVE (right-click → Open with) |
| Build fails silently | Run from Command Prompt to see errors |
| Game crashes on startup | Run RUN.bat first to test uncompressed version |
